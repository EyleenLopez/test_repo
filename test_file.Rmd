## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```




```{r}
library(gardenR)
```
```{r}
head(mpg)
```








```{r}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=cty,
             y=class))+
  geom_jitter(height=.3,
              color="lightblue")+
  labs(tittle="Smaller cars potentially have better city MPG, on average"),
x="",
y="",
caption="Eyleen & Bello made this")+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(plot.title.position="plot",
        panel.grid.major.y=element_blank())
